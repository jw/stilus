### Current tasks (0.6.0)

The first cases release, a.k.a. `committers, committers, committers!`

 - [x] Added all remaining nodes.
 - [x] Recreated the `.clone()` method for all nodes; the current one were far too slow; and very WRONG!
 - [ ] Pass 50 Stylus test cases.  7/50 done, or 14% :)
 - [ ] Try to get coverage above 70%. Aim for 80%; 75% will be fine.
 - [ ] Add tests for `to_json()`, `equal()`, `coerce()`, `clone()` and `operate()` in all nodes.
 - [ ] Finalize the compiler.
 - [ ] Finalize the evaluator.
 - [ ] Finalize the parser.
 - [ ] Add 3.7 and 3.8 Python.
 - [ ] Create all builtin functions. 3/62 done, or 4.84% ;-)
