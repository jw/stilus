### Current tasks (0.6.0)

The first cases release, a.k.a. `committers, committers, committers!`

 - [x] Added all remaining nodes.
 - [x] Recreated the `.clone()` method for all nodes; the current one were far too slow; and very WRONG!
 - [x] Add 3.7 and 3.8 Python.
 - [x] Start using Sphinx and web documentation: https://stilus.readthedocs.io.
 - [x] Pass 50 Stylus test cases.  73/50 done, or 146% :)
 - [ ] Try to get coverage above 70%. Aim for 80%; 75% will be fine.  At 80%!
 - [ ] Create all builtin functions. 54/62 done, or 87.10% ;-)
       Still to do: replace, selector-exists, selector, slice, split, substr, transparentify and use.
