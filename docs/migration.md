## Migration

### General

 - Often `push` is used to add an element to a list in Stylus; in Stilus an append needs to be used.

### Nodes

 - All `node` types are set via the `node_name` attribute.
 - The `value` attribute of a `node` is used to denote its value, while in Stylus JavaScript implementation `val` is used.
