## Architecture

### Nodes

`Node` is the root of all nodes.  All `node` types are set via the `node_name`
attribute.  The `value` attribute of a `node` is used to denote its value,
while in Stylus JavaScript implementation `val` is used.

#### globa bs common

The Styls `global` in the `Evaluator` is called `common`.
